# retiNO

Just say **"no!"** to Retina with retiNO! Makes Minecraft render at half resolution on Retina displays, which is probably enough for you anyway and has the advantage of not murdering your performance and its extended family.

Download in [the releases section](https://github.com/juliand665/retiNO/releases) or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/retino).
